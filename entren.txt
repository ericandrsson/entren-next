Purpose and Vision: Entrén is an accessibility-focused digital platform designed to provide users with verified information about entrances to public spaces, such as restaurants, shops, and buildings. The core purpose of Entrén is to make it easier for individuals, especially those with mobility challenges, to plan their visits by ensuring they have accurate, reliable, and up-to-date information about the accessibility of entrances. By crowdsourcing entrance submissions from users and verifying them, Entrén helps foster a more inclusive environment for everyone.

Key Features:

Verified Entrance Information: Users can browse and view verified entrances for various locations, ensuring they have accurate details on accessibility options.
User Submissions: Community-driven submissions allow users to add new entrances, making the platform more comprehensive over time.
Pending Review System: Submitted entrances are marked as “pending” until verified, clearly communicating which information is confirmed and which is awaiting approval.
Accessibility Focus: Designed with accessibility at its core, ensuring all users, including those with disabilities, can easily navigate and interact with the platform.
Target Audience:

Primary Audience: Individuals with mobility challenges or disabilities who need accurate information about accessible entrances.
Secondary Audience: Family members, caregivers, and friends who assist in planning trips, as well as advocates for accessibility.
